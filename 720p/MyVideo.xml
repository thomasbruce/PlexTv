	<!-- Here, if "defaultcontrol always" is set to "true", it will always select the view value noted here when returning, even if the user had selected another one when last time there. It won't stick, because it's set to be *always* the same one, independently of the choice a user makes. In other words, for a view selection to be able to be set by the user, it needs to be "false". When "false", the view by default (when coming there for the first time etc.) is the view with the value noted here, but if the user selects another one, it will stick for the next time they come back. -->

For example, traditionally the "List" view is "50", but you can do them how you like. Here, i have listed the 2 views available, and given them the values of "50" (the original "List" view) and "51" (the new "List" view) -->
